@user: This is a complex task that should be decomposed into three child tasks. Please DECOMPOSE this into three child tasks:

Task 1: Create file1.txt with "Task 1";

Task 2: Modify the contents of /nonexistent/impossible/path.txt by adding "Hello" to it - this task is impossible and should be marked as STUCK when you cannot do it;

Task 3: Ceate file3.txt with "Task 3".
