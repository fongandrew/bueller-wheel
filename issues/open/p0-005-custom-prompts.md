@user: Let's make it easy to customize the prompt for repeated use. The script should accept a `--prompt` that points to a prompt file (by default, `issues/prompt.md`). If there is no prompt there, the script writes our default one.

The prompt markdown file should be a TEMPLATE. Replace current template literal replacements with hard-coded strings (maybe wrapped with brackets). Document template variables in README.md.
