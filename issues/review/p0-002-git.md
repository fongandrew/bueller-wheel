@user: Add a way to automatically commit changes to git when complete. Git commit messages should preference the ID (as derived from the file name) of an issue. It should be something we can opt in or out of via CLI args.

---

@claude: I have implemented the automatic git commit feature.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Added a new `--git-commit` CLI flag to enable/disable automatic commits (disabled by default)
- Updated the `Config` interface to include a `gitCommit` boolean field
- Implemented `extractIssueId()` function to extract issue ID from filenames (e.g., "p0-002-git.md" → "p0-002")
- Implemented `gitCommit()` function that:
  - Checks if there are any changes to commit
  - Stages all changes with `git add -A`
  - Creates a commit with the issue ID in the message format: `[issue-id] Auto-commit after completing issue`
- Modified the main loop to detect when an issue is completed (moved from `open/` to `review/`)
- Triggers automatic git commit only when `--git-commit` flag is enabled and issue is completed
- Updated README.md with documentation on the new feature, including usage examples and notes
- Added display of git auto-commit status in the startup console output

@user: Update so that moving things to moved to stuck or just any work on an issue also commits.

@claude: I have updated the git commit feature to commit on any work done on an issue.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Modified the main loop logic in `src/bueller.ts` to detect three scenarios:
  1. Issue moved from `open/` to `review/` (completed)
  2. Issue moved from `open/` to `stuck/` (blocked)
  3. Issue still in `open/` (work in progress)
- Updated git commit to trigger in all three scenarios when `--git-commit` flag is enabled
- Updated console messages to indicate which scenario triggered the commit
- Updated README.md to reflect the new behavior:
  - Changed description from "when issues are completed" to "after each iteration where work was done"
  - Added bullet list explaining all three commit scenarios
  - Updated notes to clarify commits happen for work in progress, not just completion
- Verified all changes pass `pnpm run lint:fix` and `pnpm run typecheck`

@user: We should always commit if there are chagnes and there is a `currentIssue`. Maybe we can just tweak the commit messages though.

Also, the issue ID in the commit message should be the entire file. So the commit message for this issue should include `p0-002-git`. Maybe the messages can just be:
- `p0-002-git done`
- `p0-002-git in progress`
- `p0-002-git stuck`
- `p0-002-git ???` (if somehow none of the above)

@claude: I have updated the git commit feature to always commit when there are changes and simplified the commit messages.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Simplified `extractIssueId()` to return the full issue ID (e.g., `p0-002-git` instead of `p0-002`)
- Updated `gitCommit()` function to accept a `status` parameter for the commit message
- Simplified the main loop logic to always commit if `gitCommit` is enabled and there's a `currentIssue`
- Removed complex conditional logic - now just checks where the issue ended up to determine status
- Updated commit message format to be simpler:
  - `p0-002-git done` (when moved to review)
  - `p0-002-git in progress` (when still in open)
  - `p0-002-git stuck` (when moved to stuck)
  - `p0-002-git unknown` (fallback if issue not found)
- Updated README.md to document the new commit message format and behavior
- Updated CLI option description from "when issues are completed" to "after each iteration"
- Verified all changes pass `pnpm run lint:fix` and `pnpm run typecheck`
